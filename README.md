# Exponential-HMC

Hello, this is the implementation of exponential HMC.

Please refer to the ICML 2015 paper for more details:
Wei-Lun Chao, Justin Solomon, Dominik Michels, and Fei Sha, "Exponential Integration for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo," ICML 2015.

The codes are not fully ready yet. If you have any problem with them, please email weilunc@usc.edu, thanks.

To compare with Riemannian Manifold HMC and Lagrangian HMC, please download the codes from the authors at:
